This repository contains data and program codes of my thesis work entitles "Deciphering Cell-Cell Communication: Investigating the Impact of Sequencing Coverage and Evaluating Computational Approaches for Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Data Analysis" submitted to the Biodata Analysis PgCert Program.

There are four R scripts which produce the figures shown in the thesis for the four different sampling methods. The scripts use several libraries, for example liana, and ggplot2, which needs to be installed in R to run the programs.

The liana_csvs folder contains the data. The path of this folder needs to be set in each R script before running it.
